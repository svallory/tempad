 * the whole file against a half-renamed schema, and whether that self-heals
 * depended on every residual statement happening to fail with one of the two
 * tolerated messages. That is recovery by coincidence; a transaction makes it

/**
 * Some tables (`traces`, `stints`, `quests`) are projection tables
 * created lazily by `ensureTables` (`src/intent/projections/index.ts`), not
 * by a migration -- so an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` targeting one of them
 * fails with "no such table" on a database where the intent layer was never
 * used. That's fine: the projection's own `createSql` already includes the
 * column for any table it creates from scratch, so skipping the ALTER here
 * is a no-op, not data loss.
 *
 * Only migration files that consist solely of such statements go through
 * this per-statement, tolerant path; every other migration (some of which
 * define triggers whose bodies contain their own semicolons, e.g.
 * 0003_events.sql) still runs as one plain `exec` so its statements are
 * never split apart.
 *
 * The tolerance is deliberately narrow, and covers exactly two messages:
 *
 * - "no such table" -- 0006, 0007, 0010 and 0011 target projection tables that
 *   a never-used intent layer has not created yet.
 * - "no such column" -- 0011's `RENAME COLUMN`s target columns that a
 *   freshly-created projection table already has under the new name.
 *
 * Every other error propagates and rolls the whole migration back
 * (see `applyMigration`). Skipping is safe only because these statements are
 * idempotent with respect to a table the projection creates correctly from
 * scratch; it is not a general "ignore migration errors" path.
