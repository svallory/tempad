 * A `window.classified` event records that a backfill window (a chunk of a
 * Claude session's messages, see `chunkByWindow` in `src/w5/backfill.ts`)
 * was successfully classified and applied -- independent of how many trace
 * segments the classifier split it into. `isWindowCovered` checks this
 * table instead of `traces` so a window that produced 2+ segments (and
 * therefore 2+ traces, none of which individually span the window's exact
 * bounds) is still correctly recognized as already covered on the next run.
