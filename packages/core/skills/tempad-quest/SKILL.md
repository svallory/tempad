# tempad-quest

TemPad tracks the human's attention, not the agent's — declare which quest the coming work
pursues, so tempad places it under the right outcome instead of guessing.

## Glossary

- **Quest**: planned work with an outcome. A quest may _advance_ another quest (contributing
  work) or _deviate from_ one; a quest that deviates is a side quest. Never both.
- **Stint**: a stretch of your attention pursuing one quest. It starts when you begin pursuing an
  outcome and ends when that outcome is delivered, abandoned or handed off, or after an idle gap.
  Stints interleave. It lasts at least `stint_min_minutes` (default 5); shorter stretches are
  maneuvers, folded into the quest's time without a stint of their own.
- **Maneuver**: anything done inside a stint (read a file, run tests, rebase, check on a dev,
  answer a clarifying question). Never reported on its own.

Three tests for a stint: **the report test** (its own standup/timesheet line?), **the
same-answer test** ("what am I finishing" doesn't change), **the handoff test** (over once the
outcome leaves your hands; waiting isn't a stint, checking on someone is a maneuver of the stint
that handed off).

## Declare

Every `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects `tempad: session <id>, active quests: <title> [Q1], <title>
[Q2]. Declare with the tempad-quest skill if this prompt starts a different outcome.` (`none` =
nothing declared). Read it fresh each turn; do not track it yourself.

Declare at session start; on every new quest (plain re-declaration, or
`--origin`/`--trigger`/`--kind` for a detour); inside every subagent with `--parent`, even
matching the parent's outcome; and when a quest is done, with `--done`:

```
tempad quest declare --session <id> --new "<title>" --outcome "<text>" --commitment personal
tempad quest declare --session <id> --quest <existing-quest-id>
tempad quest declare --session <id> --new "<title>" --outcome "<text>" \
  --origin <quest id you're branching from> --trigger "<the sentence that caused the pivot>" \
  --kind waiting|blocker|curiosity|unknown
tempad quest declare --session <subagent session id> --parent <parent session id> \
  --quest <quest id> --plan "Refactor the window builder and ship it as a PR"
tempad quest declare --session <id> --done <quest>
```

`--commitment promised` for something expected delivered, `exploratory` for investigation with no
fixed deliverable, `personal` otherwise. Other work while a quest is active? If it advances the
active quest, `--advances`; otherwise `--deviates-from` and say what pulled you away.

## The plan

`--plan` lists the **stints** you expect, not maneuvers — apply the three tests above to each line.

- Wrong: `"read the brief; edit window.ts; run tests"` — three maneuvers of one stint.
- Right: `"Refactor the window builder and ship it as a PR"` — one stint, one outcome.

Re-declaring an active quest with a new `--plan` amends it.
